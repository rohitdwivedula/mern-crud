# IS F341 - Software Engineering

Tutorials to [install](tutorials/installation.md) and [deploy](tutorials/deploy.md) this app are explained in the `.md` files in the `tutorials` directory.

- This application uses PassportJS + Google OAuth for authentication.
- The tutorials use Heroku for deployment and TravisCI for continuous integration.
- A couple of unit tests have been written using Mocha and Chai, while a frontend test has been setup using CypressJS.
- The Shards React Dashboard template is used to create a (very minimal) dashboard for the application. 

The `tutorials` folder also contains PDFs of tutorials and other class materials, that explain the app a bit more.
